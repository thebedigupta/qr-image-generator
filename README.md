# Url-into-qr-image-converter

Hey everyone in this project I have created a complete web app where a user can enter any URL and then a QR image will be generated based on the URL that is entered by the user.

## What things I am used

In this project, I created a front end using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for the back end, I am using NodeJS and ExpressJS, mainly using two npm packages. The first is inquirer, which strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command-line interface for Node.js and the second is qr-image This is yet another QR Code generator, and for connecting both ends, I am using the HTTP protocol.


### How to run in your local machine

1. When you are downloading all files I will prefer to download in Zip files.
2. Before running this in your local machine you have to install NodeJS.
3. Go to the backend folder and target your git terminal in your back end and run this command "npm i inquirer qr-image.
4. Now you can see some files will be downloaded and three new files will be created name as package.json, Package-lock.json.
5. Now you have edit package.json file and there you have to write "type":"module" over dependencies inside javascript object curly braces.
