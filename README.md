# Url-into-qr-image-converter

Hey everyone! In this project, I have created a complete web app where a user can enter any URL, and then a QR image will be generated based on the URL that is entered by the user.


## What things I am used

In this project, I just used simple things to learn one thing at a time without getting too involved in other processes so I used only a few javascript lines of code and javascript libraries and not so much styling and other things
