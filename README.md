# Url-into-qr-image-converter
Hey everyone in this project I have created a complete web app where a user can enter any URL and then a QR image will be generated based on the URL that is entered by the user

# What things I am used
In this project, I created a front end using basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for the back end, I am using NodeJS and ExpressJS, mainly using two npm packages. The first is inquirer, which strives to be an easily embeddable and beautiful command-line interface for Node.js and the second is qr-image This is yet another QR Code generator, and for connecting both ends, I am using the HTTP protocol.
